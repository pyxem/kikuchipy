    from EMsoft's HDF5 file format :cite:`callahan2013dynamical`.

    Not meant to be used directly; use :func:`~kikuchipy.load`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename
        Full file path of the HDF file.
    energy
        Desired beam energy or energy range. If not given (default), all
        available energies are read.
    projection
        Projection(s) to read. Options are ``"stereographic"`` (default)
        or ``"lambert"``.
    hemisphere
        Projection hemisphere(s) to read. Options are ``"upper"``
        (default), ``"lower"`` or ``"both"``. If ``"both"``, these will
        be stacked in the vertical navigation axis.
    lazy
        Open the data lazily without actually reading the data from disk
        until requested. Allows opening datasets larger than available
        memory. Default is ``False``.
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments passed to :class:`h5py.File`.

    Returns
    -------
    signal_dict_list
        Data, axes, metadata and original metadata.
