    r"""Read all images in a directory, assuming they are electron
    backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns of equal shape and data
    type.

    Not meant to be used directly; use :func:`~kikuchipy.load`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename
        Name of directory with patterns.
    xy_pattern
        Regular expression to extract map coordinates from the
        filenames. If not given, two regular expressions will be tried:
        assuming (x, y) = (5, 10), "_x5y10.tif" or "-5-10.bmp".
        Valid ``xy_pattern`` equal to these are ``r"_x(\d+)y(\d+).tif"``
        and ``r"-(\d+)-(\d+).bmp"``, respectively. If none of these
        expressions match the first file's name in the directory, a
        warning is printed and the returned signal will have only one
        navigation dimension.
    show_progressbar
        Whether to show a progressbar when reading the signal into
        memory when ``lazy=False``.
    lazy
        Read the patterns lazily without actually reading them from disk
        until required. Default is ``False``.

    Returns
    -------
    scan
        Data, axes, metadata and original metadata.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        If navigation coordinates can not be read from the filenames.
    UserWarning
        If there are more detected patterns in the directory than the
        navigation shape determined from the filenames suggest.
