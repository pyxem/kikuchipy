==================

Contributors
------------
- Håkon Wiik Ånes

Added

  control possible rechunking of pattern array before refinement.
  (`#470 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/470>`_)

0.5.3 (2021-11-02)
==================

Contributors

- Performance improvements to EBSD dictionary generation, giving a substantial speed-up.
  (`#405 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/405>`_)

- URLs of user guide topics have an extra "/user_guide/<topic>" added to them.
  (`#403 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/403>`_)

  metadata array will become available as an EBSD property.
  (`#428 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/428>`_)

Removed

Contributors
------------
- Håkon Wiik Ånes

Fixed
-------
- Allow reading of EBSD patterns from h5ebsd files with arbitrary scan group names, not

  frequency domain to get the dynamic background to remove.
  (`#157 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/157>`_)

Removed
-------
- Explicit dependency on scikit-learn (it is imported via HyperSpy).
  (`#168 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/168>`_)
- Dependency on pyxem. Parts of their virtual imaging methods are adapted here---a big
  thank you to the pyxem/HyperSpy team!
  (`#168 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/168>`_)

Fixed
-----
- RtD builds documentation with Python 3.8 (fixed problem of missing .egg leading build
  to fail). (`#158 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/158>`_)

0.1.3 (2020-05-11)
==================

kikuchipy is an open-source Python library for processing and analysis of electron
backscatter diffraction patterns: https://kikuchipy.org.

This is a patch release. It is anticipated to be the final release in the `0.1.x`
series.

Added
-----
- Package installation with Anaconda via the `conda-forge channel
  <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kikuchipy/>`_.

Fixed
-----
- Static and dynamic background corrections are done at float 32-bit precision, and not
  integer 16-bit.
- Chunking of static background pattern.
- Chunking of patterns in the h5ebsd reader.

0.1.2 (2020-01-09)
==================

kikuchipy is an open-source Python library for processing and analysis of electron
backscatter diffraction patterns: https://kikuchipy.org.

This is a bug-fix release that ensures, unlike the previous bug-fix release, that
necessary files are downloaded when installing from PyPI.

0.1.1 (2020-01-04)
==================

This is a bug fix release that ensures that necessary files are uploaded to PyPI.

0.1.0 (2020-01-04)
==================

We're happy to announce the release of kikuchipy v0.1.0!

kikuchipy is an open-source Python library for processing and analysis of electron
backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns. The library builds upon the tools for
multi-dimensional data analysis provided by the HyperSpy library.

For more information, a user guide, and the full reference API documentation, please
visit: https://kikuchipy.org.

This is the initial pre-release, where things start to get serious... seriously fun!

Features
--------
- Load EBSD patterns and metadata from the NORDIF binary format (.dat), or Bruker Nano's
  or EDAX TSL's h5ebsd formats (.h5) into an ``EBSD`` object, e.g. ``s``, based upon
  HyperSpy's `Signal2D` class, using ``s = kp.load()``. This ensures easy access to
  patterns and metadata in the attributes ``s.data`` and ``s.metadata``, respectively.
- Save EBSD patterns to the NORDIF binary format (.dat) and our own h5ebsd format (.h5),
  using ``s.save()``. Both formats are readable by EMsoft's NORDIF and EMEBSD readers,
  respectively.
- All functionality in kikuchipy can be performed both directly and lazily (except some
  multivariate analysis algorithms). The latter means that all operations on a scan,
  including plotting, can be done by loading only necessary parts of the scan into
  memory at a time. Ultimately, this lets us operate on scans larger than memory using
  all of our cores.
- Visualize patterns easily with HyperSpy's powerful and versatile ``s.plot()``. Any
  image of the same navigation size, e.g. a virtual backscatter electron image, quality
  map, phase map, or orientation map, can be used to navigate in. Multiple scans of the
  same size, e.g. a scan of experimental patterns and the best matching simulated
  patterns to that scan, can be plotted simultaneously with HyperSpy's
  ``plot_signals()``.
- Virtual backscatter electron (VBSE) imaging is easily performed with
  ``s.virtual_backscatter_electron_imaging()`` based upon similar functionality in
  pyXem. Arbitrary regions of interests can be used, and the corresponding VBSE image
  can be inspected interactively. Finally, the VBSE image can be obtained in a new
  ``EBSD`` object with ``vbse = s.get_virtual_image()``, before writing the data to an
  image file in your desired format with matplotlib's
  ``imsave('filename.png', vbse.data)``.
- Change scan and pattern size, e.g. by cropping on the detector or extracting a region
  of interest, by using ``s.isig`` or ``s.inav``, respectively. Patterns can be binned
  (upscaled or downscaled) using ``s.rebin``. These methods are provided by HyperSpy.
- Perform static and dynamic background correction by subtraction or division with
  ``s.static_background_correction()`` and ``s.dynamic_background_correction()``. For
  the former correction, relative intensities between patterns can be kept if desired.
- Perform adaptive histogram equalization by setting an appropriate contextual region
  (kernel size) with ``s.adaptive_histogram_equalization()``.
- Rescale pattern intensities to desired data type and range using
  ``s.rescale_intensities()``.
- Multivariate statistical analysis, like principal component analysis and many other
  decomposition algorithms, can be easily performed with ``s.decomposition()``, provided
  by HyperSpy.
- Since the ``EBSD`` class is based upon HyperSpy's ``Signal2D`` class, which itself is
  based upon their ``BaseSignal`` class, all functionality available to ``Signal2D`` is
  also available to the ``EBSD`` class. See HyperSpy's user guide
  (http://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/index.html) for details.
