kikuchipy is a library for processing, simulating and indexing of electron backscatter
diffraction (EBSD) patterns in Python, built on the tools for multi-dimensional data
analysis provided by the HyperSpy library: https://kikuchipy.org.

All user facing changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is based
on `Keep a Changelog <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0>`__, and this project tries
its best to adhere to `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`__.

List entries are sorted in descending chronological order. Contributors to each release
were listed in alphabetical order by first name until version 0.7.0.

Unreleased
==========

Added
-----
- Explicit support for Python 3.11.
  (`#646 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/646>`_)
- Allow Hough indexing of all Laue groups with PyEBSDIndex v0.2 (not just *m-3m*, i.e.
  FCC and BCC). (`#652 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/652>`_)
- Control of reflector lists in Hough indexing. One reflector list per phase in the
  phase list can be passed to ``EBSDDetector.get_indexer()`` when obtaining the
  ``EBSDIndexer`` for use in ``EBSD.hough_indexing()``.
  (`#652 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/652>`_)
- Allow passing keyword arguments to ``EBSD.hough_indexing_optimize_pc()`` to control
  particle swarm optimization (PSO). These are passed on to the new PSO algorithm in
  PyEBSDIndex v0.2. (`#652 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/652>`_)
- Allow getting one projection center (PC) per pattern when optimizing PCs using the new
  particle swarm optimization in PyEBSDIndex v0.2 (passing ``batch=True``).
  (`#652 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/652>`_)
- Dependency on RosettaSciIO 0.1 for read/write support previously imported from

  (`#652 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/652>`_)
- Allow passing keyword arguments to ``EBSD.hough_indexing_optimize_pc()`` to control
  the new particle swarm optimization algorithm in PyEBSDIndex v0.2.
  (`#652 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/652>`_)
- Allow getting one projection center (PC) per pattern when optimizing PCs using the new
  particle swarm optimization in PyEBSDIndex v0.2 (passing ``batch=True``).
  (`#652 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/652>`_)

Changed
-------
- Parameter ``zone_axes_kwargs`` in
  ``GeometricalKikuchiPatternSimulation.as_collections()`` does not accept ``color``
  internally to set the default color to white anymore. It accepts ``fc`` (facecolor)
  instead. This change was necessary to improve handling of other keyword arguments.
  (`#643 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/643>`_)
- Increase minimal versions of diffsims, NumPy, Matplotlib, and PyEBSDIndex to 0.5.1,
  1.21.6, 3.5, and 0.2, respectively.
  (`#646 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/646>`_,
  `#652 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/652>`_)
- Remove dependency on Panel for documentation, and with that the interactive 3D
  visualization of master patterns in the documentation. The plan is to reintroduce the
  interactive plots with trame later on.
  (`#652 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/652>`_)
- Restrict HyperSpy to below the forthcoming version 2. The plan is to remove this
  restriction once kikuchipy is compatible with this version.
  (`#657 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/657>`_)

Removed
-------
- ``generators`` and ``projections`` modules which were deprecated in version 0.8.
  (`#612 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/612>`_)
- The deprecated PyPI selector ``viz`` is removed.
  (`#643 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/643>`_)
- The data module functions ``silicon_ebsd_moving_screen_x()``, where "x" is "in",
  "out5mm" or "out10mm". They were deprecated in version 0.8.
  (`#656 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/656>`_)

Fixed
-----
- Conversion from EDAX TSL projection center (PC) convention for (PCy, PCz) for
  rectangular detectors is corrected.
  (`#652 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/652>`_)
- Downloading files in the ``data`` module to the local cache on Windows.
  (`#655 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/655>`_)

0.8.7 (2023-07-24)
==================

Fixed
-----
- Passing a 3-component PC array with more than one dimension to
  ``EBSD.hough_indexing_optimize_pc()`` works.
  (`#647 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/647>`_)

0.8.6 (2023-05-29)
==================

Changed
-------
- Use memory mapping (``numpy.memmap()``) instead of reading into memory
  (``numpy.fromfile()``) for non-lazy reading of EBSD patterns from EDAX binary .up1/2
  files. (`#641 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/641>`_)

Fixed
-----
- EBSD patterns from some EDAX binary .up1/2 files were incorrectly read due to an
  incorrect file offset, making the patterns appear shifted horizontally.
  (`#641 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/641>`_)
- Reading of EBSD patterns from H5OINA files with the "Camera Binning Mode" dataset not
  containing the detector binning.
  (`#641 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/641>`_)

0.8.5 (2023-05-21)
==================

Fixed
-----
- Not-indexed points in crystal maps are handled correctly when merging.
  (`#639 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/639>`_)

==================

Fixed
-----
- Points considered not-indexed in a crystal map are maintained after EBSD refinement.
  (`#632 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/632>`_)

Changed
-------
- EBSD detector returned from combined EBSD and projection center (PC) refinement now
  has PC values equal to the number of indexed points, accounting for points not being
  in the data, navigation mask *and* points considered as not-indexed. This means that
  it might not have a 2D navigation shape, even though the returned crystal map has.
  (`#632 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/632>`_)

0.8.3 (2023-03-23)
==================

Changed
-------
- ``EBSD.hough_indexing()`` info message now informs that the given projection center is
  in Bruker's convention. (`#628 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/628>`_)

0.8.2 (2023-03-14)
==================

Changed
-------
- Set minimal version of orix to >= 0.11.1.
  (`#623 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/623>`_)

0.8.1 (2023-02-20)
==================

Fixed
-----
- Hough indexing with PyEBSDIndex of a lazy EBSD signal requires not only PyOpenCL to be
  installed, but also for PyOpenCL to be able to create a context.
  (`#615 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/615>`_)
- Missing progressbars for ``EBSD`` methods ``average_neighbour_patterns()`` and
  ``fft_filter()`` reintroduced. (`#615 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/615>`_)

- EBSD signal returned from NORDIF calibration pattern reader tries to add the following
  new info to the original metadata: Shapes of area and region of interest (ROI), offset

- Seven EBSD master pattern files simulated with EMsoft are available from
  ``ebsd_master_pattern()`` via the data module for download to the local cache:
  aluminium, nickel, silicon, austenite, ferrite, a chi-phase in steel and a sigma-phase
  in steel. (`#584 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/584>`_,
  `#607 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/607>`_)
- Some experimental EBSD datasets are available for download to the local cache via the

  ``ni_gain_calibration(number)``.
  (`#584 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/584>`_,
  `#593 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/593>`_,
  `#607 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/607>`_)
- When using the following HyperSpy ``Signal2D`` methods via the ``EBSD`` class, the
  class attributes ``xmap``, ``static_background`` and ``detector`` are handled
  correctly, which they were not before: ``inav``, ``isig``, ``crop()``,
  ``crop_image()``. If handling fails, the old behavior is retained. This handling is
  experimental. (`#578 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/578>`_)
- ``EBSDDetector.crop()`` method to get a new detector with its shape cropped, also
  updating the PC values accordingly.
  (`#578 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/578>`_)

Changed
-------
- Minimal version of orix set to >= 0.11 and of Numba set to >= 0.55.
  (`#608 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/608>`_)
- Added warnings when trying to perform adaptive histogram equalization on a signal with
  data in floating type or when some of the data is NaN.
  (`#606 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/606>`_)
- Dask arrays returned from EBSD refinement methods has the number of function
  evaluations as the second element after the score.
  (`#593 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/593>`_)
- Stricter phase comparison in EBSD refinement. The phase in the crystal map points to
  refine must have the same name, space group, point group and structure (atoms and
  lattice) as the master pattern phase.
  (`#593 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/593>`_)
- Passing two crystal maps with identical phases when merging returns a map with one
  phase instead of two and does not raise a warning, as before.
  (`#593 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/593>`_)
- Exclude documentation and tests from source distribution.
  (`#588 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/588>`_)
- Minimal version of HyperSpy increased to >= 1.7.3.
  (`#585 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/585>`_)
- When binning the navigation dimension(s) with ``EBSD.rebin()``, the class attributes
  ``xmap`` and ``static_background`` are set to ``None`` and ``detector.pc`` is set to
  ``[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]`` in the appropriate navigation shape. If the signal dimension(s)
  are binned, the ``static_background`` is binned similarly while the ``detector.shape``
  and ``detector.binning`` are updated. If this handling of attributes fails, the old
  behavior is retained. This handling is experimental.
  (`#578 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/578>`_)
- EBSD signal loaded with ``nickel_ebsd_small()`` and ``nickel_ebsd_large()`` now
  contain crystal maps with orientations and detectors with PC values found from Hough
  indexing with PyEBSDIndex followed by orientation and PC refinement.
  (`#578 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/578>`_,
  `#584 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/584>`_)
- Minimal version of Matplotlib is 3.5.0 when installing optional dependencies with
  ``pip install kikuchipy[viz]`` since PyVista requires this.
  (`#578 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/578>`_)

Deprecated
----------
- ``kikuchipy.generators.VirtualBSEGenerator`` class is deprecated and will be removed
  in version 0.9. Use ``kikuchipy.imaging.VirtualBSEImager`` instead.
  (`#608 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/608>`_)
- The data module functions ``silicon_ebsd_moving_screen_x()``, where "x" is "in",
  "out5mm" or "out10mm", are deprecated and will be removed in v0.9. Use
  ``si_ebsd_moving_screen(distance)`` instead, where ``distance`` is ``0`` (in), ``5``
  or ``10``. (`#607 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/607>`_)
- The PyPI selector ``viz`` is replaced by ``all``, which installs all optional
  dependencies. ``viz`` will be removed in version 0.9. Install optional dependencies
  manually or via ``pip install kikuchipy[all]``.
  (`#590 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/590>`_)
- ``projections`` module with classes ``GnomonicProjection``, ``HesseNormalForm``,
  ``LambertProjection`` and ``SphericalProjection``. These will be removed in version
  0.9.0, as they are unused internally. If you depend on this module, please open an
  issue at https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/issues.
  (`#577 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/577>`_)

Removed
-------

  available in the returned signal's ``detector`` attribute.
  (`#600 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/600>`_)
- Range of (kinematical) intensities in ``KikuchiPatternSimulator.plot()`` maximizes the
  strongest reflectors (make black) instead of minimizing the weakest reflectors (make
  white), which was the previous behavior.
  (`#599 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/599>`_)
- Inversion of ``signal_mask`` in the normalized cross-correlation and normalized dot
  product metrics is now done internally, to be in line with the docstrings (does not
  affect the use of this parameter and ``metric="ncc"`` or ``metric="ndp"`` in
  ``EBSD.dictionary_indexing()``).
  (`#593 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/593>`_)
- ``EBSDDetector.pc_average`` no longer rounds the PC to three decimals.
  (`#586 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/586>`_)
- Microscope magnification is now read correctly from EDAX h5ebsd files.
  (`#586 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/586>`_)

  different navigation shape than determined from the HDF5 file's navigation shape
  (e.g. ``Scan 1/EBSD/Header/n_columns`` and ``n_rows``).
  (`#578 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/578>`_)

==================

Added
-----
- Signal mask passed to EBSD orientation and projection center refinement methods is now
  applied to the experimental pattern as well.
  (`#573 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/573>`_)
- Dependency ``imageio`` needed for reading EBSD patterns in image files.
  (`#570 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/570>`_)
- Reader of an ``EBSD`` signal from all images in a directory assuming they are of the
  same shape and data type. (`#570 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/570>`_)
- Reader of an ``EBSD`` signal from EDAX TSL's binary UP1/UP2 file formats.
  (`#569 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/569>`_)
- Ability to project simulate patterns from a master pattern using varying projection
  centers (PCs) in ``EBSDMasterPattern.get_patterns()``. An example is added to the
  method to show this. (`#567 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/567>`_)
- Allow not setting ``energy`` parameter in ``EBSDMasterPattern.get_patterns()``, upon
  which the highest energy available is used.
  (`#567 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/567>`_)
- Improved handling of custom attributes ``xmap``, ``detector`` and
  ``static_background`` in ``EBSD`` and ``hemisphere``, ``phase`` and ``projection`` in
  EBSD/ECP master pattern classes when calling inherited HyperSpy ``Signal2D`` methods
  ``as_lazy()``, ``change_dtype()``, ``compute()``, ``deepcopy()``,
  ``set_signal_type()`` and ``squeeze()``.

  file into an ``EBSDMasterPattern`` signal.
  (`#564 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/564>`_)

  ``hs.preferences.General.show_progressbar`` (see their docs for details).
  (`#550 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/550>`_)

Changed
-------
- Documentation theme from *Furo* to *PyData*, as the growing API reference is easier to
  navigate with the latter. (`#574 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/574>`_)
- Use Rodrigues-Frank vector components (Rx, Ry, Rz) instead of Euler angles in EBSD
  orientation and projection center refinement methods. This means that if refinement is
  not directly but a Dask array is returned from any of these methods, the data which
  previously contained Euler angles now contain these vector components. This change was
  done to speed up refinement. (`#573 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/573>`_)
- Most of the ``EBSD`` metadata structure is removed, in an effort to move all relevant
  data to the attributes ``xmap``, ``static_background``, and ``detector``.
  (`#562 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/562>`_)
- h5ebsd plugin split into one plugin for each h5ebsd format (kikuchipy, EDAX TSL, and
  Bruker Nano).

- Import modules lazily using the specification in `PEP 562
  <https://peps.python.org/pep-0562/>`__.
  (`#551 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/551>`_)
- Minimal version of HyperSpy increased to >= 1.7.1.
  (`#550 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/550>`_)
- ``progressbar`` parameter to ``show_progressbar`` in ``kikuchipy.data`` functions
  which accepts a ``allow_download`` parameter. If not given, the value is retreived
  from HyperSpy's preferences. (`#550 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/550>`_)

Deprecated
----------
- ``mask`` parameter in EBSD orientation and projection center refinement is deprecated
  in favor of ``signal_mask``, and will be removed in version 0.8.0.

Fixed
-------
- Allow reading of EBSD patterns from h5ebsd files with arbitrary scan group names, not
  just "Scan 1", "Scan 2", etc., like was the case before.
  (`#188 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/188>`_)

0.2.1 (2020-05-20)
==================

This is a patch release that enables installing kikuchipy 0.2 from Anaconda and not just
PyPI.

Contributors
------------
- Håkon Wiik Ånes

Changed
-------
- Use numpy.fft instead of scipy.fft because HyperSpy requires scipy < 1.4 on
  conda-forge, while scipy.fft was introduced in scipy 1.4.
  (`#180 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/180>`_)

Fixed
-----
- With the change above, kikuchipy 0.2 should be installable from Anaconda and not just
  PyPI. (`#180 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/180>`_)

0.2.0 (2020-05-19)
==================

  filtering in the frequency or spatial domain. Available in the kikuchipy.filters
  module.
  (`#134 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/134>`_,
  `#157 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/157>`_)

Changed
-------
- Renamed five EBSD methods: static_background_correction to remove_static_background,
  dynamic_background_correction to remove_dynamic_background, rescale_intensities to
  rescale_intensity, virtual_backscatter_electron_imaging to plot_virtual_bse_intensity,
  and get_virtual_image to get_virtual_bse_intensity.

- Read the Docs CSS style. (`#157 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/157>`_)
- New logo with a gradient from experimental to simulated pattern (with EMsoft), with a
  color gradient from the plasma color maps.
  (`#157 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/157>`_)
- Dynamic background correction can be done faster due to Gaussian blurring in the
  frequency domain to get the dynamic background to remove.
  (`#157 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/157>`_)

Removed
-------
- Explicit dependency on scikit-learn (it is imported via HyperSpy).
  (`#168 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/168>`_)
- Dependency on pyxem. Parts of their virtual imaging methods are adapted here---a big
  thank you to the pyxem/HyperSpy team!
  (`#168 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/168>`_)

Fixed
-----
- RtD builds documentation with Python 3.8 (fixed problem of missing .egg leading build
  to fail). (`#158 <https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy/pull/158>`_)

0.1.0 (2020-01-04)
==================

We're happy to announce the release of kikuchipy v0.1.0!

kikuchipy is an open-source Python library for processing and analysis of electron
backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns. The library builds upon the tools for
multi-dimensional data analysis provided by the HyperSpy library.

For more information, a user guide, and the full reference API documentation, please
visit: https://kikuchipy.org.

This is the initial pre-release, where things start to get serious... seriously fun!

Features
--------
- Load EBSD patterns and metadata from the NORDIF binary format (.dat), or Bruker Nano's
  or EDAX TSL's h5ebsd formats (.h5) into an ``EBSD`` object, e.g. ``s``, based upon
  HyperSpy's `Signal2D` class, using ``s = kp.load()``. This ensures easy access to
  patterns and metadata in the attributes ``s.data`` and ``s.metadata``, respectively.
- Save EBSD patterns to the NORDIF binary format (.dat) and our own h5ebsd format (.h5),
  using ``s.save()``. Both formats are readable by EMsoft's NORDIF and EMEBSD readers,
  respectively.
- All functionality in kikuchipy can be performed both directly and lazily (except some
  multivariate analysis algorithms). The latter means that all operations on a scan,
  including plotting, can be done by loading only necessary parts of the scan into
  memory at a time. Ultimately, this lets us operate on scans larger than memory using
  all of our cores.
- Visualize patterns easily with HyperSpy's powerful and versatile ``s.plot()``. Any
  image of the same navigation size, e.g. a virtual backscatter electron image, quality
  map, phase map, or orientation map, can be used to navigate in. Multiple scans of the
  same size, e.g. a scan of experimental patterns and the best matching simulated
  patterns to that scan, can be plotted simultaneously with HyperSpy's
  ``plot_signals()``.
- Virtual backscatter electron (VBSE) imaging is easily performed with
  ``s.virtual_backscatter_electron_imaging()`` based upon similar functionality in
  pyXem. Arbitrary regions of interests can be used, and the corresponding VBSE image
  can be inspected interactively. Finally, the VBSE image can be obtained in a new
  ``EBSD`` object with ``vbse = s.get_virtual_image()``, before writing the data to an
  image file in your desired format with matplotlib's
  ``imsave('filename.png', vbse.data)``.
- Change scan and pattern size, e.g. by cropping on the detector or extracting a region
  of interest, by using ``s.isig`` or ``s.inav``, respectively. Patterns can be binned
  (upscaled or downscaled) using ``s.rebin``. These methods are provided by HyperSpy.
- Perform static and dynamic background correction by subtraction or division with
  ``s.static_background_correction()`` and ``s.dynamic_background_correction()``. For
  the former correction, relative intensities between patterns can be kept if desired.
- Perform adaptive histogram equalization by setting an appropriate contextual region
  (kernel size) with ``s.adaptive_histogram_equalization()``.
- Rescale pattern intensities to desired data type and range using
  ``s.rescale_intensities()``.
- Multivariate statistical analysis, like principal component analysis and many other
  decomposition algorithms, can be easily performed with ``s.decomposition()``, provided
  by HyperSpy.
- Since the ``EBSD`` class is based upon HyperSpy's ``Signal2D`` class, which itself is
  based upon their ``BaseSignal`` class, all functionality available to ``Signal2D`` is
  also available to the ``EBSD`` class. See HyperSpy's user guide
  (http://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/index.html) for details.
